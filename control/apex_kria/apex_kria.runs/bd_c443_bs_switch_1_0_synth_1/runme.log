INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [/home/agreshil/vivado_projects/fw_i2c_master/apex/control/apex_kria/apex_kria.gen/sources_1/bd/design_1/ip/design_1_debug_bridge_0_0/bd_0/ip/ip_2/constraints/bs_switch.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/bd_c443_bs_switch_1_0_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/bd_c443_bs_switch_1_0_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
